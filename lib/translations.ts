    "faq.title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq.01.question": "What kind of services or projects can you develop?",
    "faq.01.answer":
      "I can develop a wide range of applications and solutions to meet your needs. This includes e-learning platforms, educational systems, personal portfolios, blogs, e-commerce stores, SaaS applications, industrial IoT solutions, stock inventory management systems, cryptocurrency platforms, restaurant management systems, hotel booking and management platforms, ticket management systems, AI model-related projects, and any real-world daily life-based projects. I also develop personal/business websites, mobile apps (iOS and Android), desktop applications, and custom software solutions. Whether you need a simple website, a complex enterprise application, or something innovative that solves everyday problems, I'm here to help bring your ideas to life. If you have a specific project in mind, let's discuss it—I'm always open to new challenges and creative solutions.",
    "faq.02.question": "What is your availability and typical project timeline?",
    "faq.02.answer":
      "I'm currently available for freelance, part-time, and full-time opportunities. Project timelines vary based on scope and complexity. For small projects (landing pages, simple web apps), I typically deliver within 1-2 weeks. Medium projects (full-stack applications, e-commerce platforms) usually take 2-6 weeks. Large enterprise projects can range from 1-3 months. I always provide detailed timelines and milestones during our initial consultation, and I'm committed to meeting deadlines while maintaining high code quality.",
    "faq.03.question": "What are your pricing models (hourly vs. project-based)?",
    "faq.03.answer":
      "I believe in building trust through results, not just promises. That's why I start every project with a free demo service—I'll create a working prototype or initial version so you can see exactly what you're getting. If you're happy with the demo and want to proceed, we'll discuss project fees that work for both of us. My focus is on helping people bring their website and mobile app ideas to life, and I'm committed to providing ongoing maintenance and support as your project grows. I don't charge hourly rates; instead, I work with a value-based, customer-happiness approach. My rates are very affordable (minimum wage level), making quality development accessible. The goal is your satisfaction and success—if you're happy with the work, that's what matters most. Let's discuss your project and find a solution that fits your needs and budget.",
    "faq.04.question": "Do you work remotely or on-site?",
    "faq.04.answer":
      "I primarily work remotely, which allows me to serve clients globally while maintaining flexibility and efficiency. I'm based in Frankfurt, Germany, and am open to on-site meetings or collaboration when needed, especially for clients in the Hessen province or for initial project kickoff meetings. I'm experienced with remote collaboration tools and maintain clear communication channels throughout projects. For international clients, I'm comfortable working across different time zones and can adjust my schedule to accommodate your needs.",
    "faq.05.question": "What technologies and tech stack do you prefer?",
    "faq.05.answer":
      "I'm a full-stack developer with expertise across multiple technologies. On the frontend, I work with React, Next.js, Angular, Vue.js, and modern CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS. For backend development, I use Node.js, .NET, Python, and build RESTful APIs. I'm experienced with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines. I also work with databases (Relational DB (PostgreSQL, MySQL), Document DB (MongoDB), Vector DB, Redis), authentication systems, and monitoring tools. I choose technologies based on project requirements, scalability needs, and client preferences. I'm always learning and adapting to new technologies as they emerge. I can work with any technology or framework, but I prefer to use the most appropriate technology for the project.",
    "faq.06.question": "What is your project process and workflow?",
    "faq.06.answer":
      "My workflow follows a structured yet flexible approach. It starts with an initial consultation (free demo service) where I understand your requirements, goals, and constraints. Then I provide a detailed proposal with timeline, milestones, and deliverables. During development, I maintain regular communication through your preferred channels (email, Slack, video calls) and provide progress updates. I follow agile methodologies, breaking work into sprints with regular check-ins. I use version control (Git), code reviews, testing, and documentation throughout. Before delivery, I conduct thorough testing and provide training/documentation. Post-launch, I offer support and maintenance options as free of charge for lifetime.",
    "faq.07.question": "How do you prefer to communicate during projects?",
    "faq.07.answer":
      "I'm flexible with communication preferences and adapt to what works best for you. I'm comfortable with personal meeting, email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or phone calls. For ongoing projects, I typically provide weekly progress updates and am available for scheduled check-ins. I respond to urgent matters promptly and maintain clear documentation of decisions and changes. I believe in transparent communication and will keep you informed about progress, challenges, and any adjustments needed. I'm also happy to work with your existing project management tools and workflows.",
    "faq.08.question": "Can you share examples of your portfolio or previous projects?",
    "faq.08.answer":
      "Absolutely! You can view my portfolio of 40+ projects on the 'Projects' page of this website, which showcases various full-stack applications, e-commerce platforms, web apps, and automation solutions. For even more examples, I have 90+ open-source production-ready projects on my GitHub repository which are currently all running in servers. These projects demonstrate my expertise across different technologies, industries, and project scales. I'm happy to discuss specific projects that relate to your needs and can provide case studies or references upon request. Each project in my Github repository includes details about the tech stack, challenges solved, and outcomes achieved.",
    "faq.09.question": "What certifications and education do you have?",
    "faq.09.answer":
      "I have a strong academic foundation combined with continuous practical learning. I hold a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in High Integrity Systems from Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences, Germany (2014-2024), and a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Computer Science & Engineering from Military Institute of Science & Technology, Bangladesh (2008-2012). Additionally, I've completed advanced web development courses including Advanced Next.js & Framer Motion Web Development (Udemy, 2023-2025) and Advanced React.js & Tailwind CSS Web Development (Udemy, 2022-2024). While my formal education provides a solid foundation, I believe in continuous learning through hands-on project experience, contributing to open-source, and staying updated with the latest industry trends. I can demonstrate my capabilities through my Github repository of 90+ production-ready open-source projects and code quality. If specific certifications are required for your project, I'm open to obtaining them.",
    "faq.10.question": "What is your location and timezone?",
    "faq.10.answer":
      "I'm based in Frankfurt, Germany (CET/CEST timezone, UTC+1/UTC+2). I work with clients globally and am flexible with scheduling to accommodate different time zones. For clients in Europe, we can easily align our working hours. For clients in the Americas or Asia, I can adjust my schedule for important meetings and maintain asynchronous communication for day-to-day work. I'm comfortable working across time zones and have experience collaborating with international teams. My location allows me to serve clients in Europe effectively while also supporting global projects.",
    "faq.11.question": "Tell me about your background and work authorization",
    "faq.11.answer":
      "I'm originally from Bangladesh and have been living in Germany for over 12 years, which has given me a deep understanding of both cultures and business environments. I hold full-time work permit and residency status in Germany, allowing me to work legally for any employer, client, or project without restrictions. This means I can take on freelance, part-time, or full-time opportunities, work with clients globally, and provide long-term commitments. My diverse background and international experience enable me to understand different perspectives and work effectively with clients from various countries and cultures. I can develop anything you need—from simple websites to complex enterprise applications—and I'm committed to delivering high-quality solutions regardless of project size or complexity.",

    "faq.01.answer":
      "Ich kann eine Vielzahl von Anwendungen und Lösungen entwickeln, um Ihre Bedürfnisse zu erfüllen. Dazu gehören E-Learning-Plattformen, Bildungssysteme, persönliche Portfolios, Blogs, E-Commerce-Shops, SaaS-Anwendungen, industrielle IoT-Lösungen, Lagerverwaltungssysteme, Kryptowährungsplattformen, Restaurantverwaltungssysteme, Hotelbuchungs- und Verwaltungsplattformen, Ticketverwaltungssysteme, KI-Modell-bezogene Projekte und alle realen, alltagsbasierten Projekte. Ich entwickle auch persönliche/Geschäftswebsites, mobile Apps (iOS und Android), Desktop-Anwendungen und maßgeschneiderte Softwarelösungen. Ob Sie eine einfache Website, eine komplexe Unternehmensanwendung oder etwas Innovatives benötigen, das alltägliche Probleme löst, ich bin hier, um Ihre Ideen zum Leben zu erwecken. Wenn Sie ein bestimmtes Projekt im Kopf haben, lassen Sie uns darüber sprechen—ich bin immer offen für neue Herausforderungen und kreative Lösungen.",

    "faq.02.answer":
      "Ich bin derzeit für freiberufliche, Teilzeit- und Vollzeitmöglichkeiten verfügbar. Projektzeitleisten variieren je nach Umfang und Komplexität. Für kleine Projekte (Landingpages, einfache Web-Apps) liefere ich normalerweise innerhalb von 1-2 Wochen. Mittlere Projekte (Full-Stack-Anwendungen, E-Commerce-Plattformen) dauern normalerweise 2-6 Wochen. Große Unternehmensprojekte können 1-3 Monate dauern. Ich stelle immer detaillierte Zeitleisten und Meilensteine während unserer ersten Beratung bereit und bin verpflichtet, Termine einzuhalten und gleichzeitig hohe Codequalität zu gewährleisten.",
    "faq.03.question": "Wie sind Ihre Preismodelle (stündlich vs. projektbasiert)?",
    "faq.03.answer":
      "Ich glaube daran, Vertrauen durch Ergebnisse aufzubauen, nicht nur durch Versprechungen. Deshalb beginne ich jedes Projekt mit einem kostenlosen Demo-Service—ich erstelle einen funktionierenden Prototyp oder eine erste Version, damit Sie genau sehen können, was Sie bekommen. Wenn Sie mit der Demo zufrieden sind und fortfahren möchten, besprechen wir Projektgebühren, die für uns beide funktionieren. Mein Fokus liegt darauf, Menschen dabei zu helfen, ihre Website- und Mobile-App-Ideen zum Leben zu erwecken, und ich bin verpflichtet, kontinuierliche Wartung und Support bereitzustellen, während Ihr Projekt wächst. Ich berechne keine Stundensätze; stattdessen arbeite ich mit einem wertbasierten, kundenzufriedenheitsorientierten Ansatz. Meine Preise sind sehr erschwinglich (Mindestlohnniveau), was qualitativ hochwertige Entwicklung zugänglich macht. Das Ziel ist Ihre Zufriedenheit und Ihr Erfolg—wenn Sie mit der Arbeit zufrieden sind, ist das das Wichtigste. Lassen Sie uns Ihr Projekt besprechen und eine Lösung finden, die Ihren Bedürfnissen und Ihrem Budget entspricht.",

Für die Backend-Entwicklung verwende ich Node.js, .NET, Python und baue RESTful APIs. Ich bin erfahren mit Cloud-Plattformen wie AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes und CI/CD-Pipelines. Ich arbeite auch mit Datenbanken (Relational DB (PostgreSQL, MySQL), Document DB (MongoDB), Vector DB, Redis), Authentifizierungssystemen und Monitoring-Tools. Ich wähle Technologien basierend auf Projektanforderungen, Skalierbarkeitsbedürfnissen und Kundenpräferenzen. Ich lerne immer und passe mich neuen Technologien an, wenn sie auftauchen. Ich kann mit jeder Technologie oder jedem Framework arbeiten, aber ich bevorzuge es, die am besten geeignete Technologie für das Projekt zu verwenden.",
    "faq.06.question": "Wie ist Ihr Projektprozess und Workflow?",
    "faq.06.answer":
      "Mein Workflow folgt einem strukturierten, aber flexiblen Ansatz. Er beginnt mit einer ersten Beratung (kostenloser Demo-Service), bei der ich Ihre Anforderungen, Ziele und Einschränkungen verstehe. Dann stelle ich einen detaillierten Vorschlag mit Zeitleiste, Meilensteinen und Liefergegenständen bereit. Während der Entwicklung halte ich regelmäßige Kommunikation über Ihre bevorzugten Kanäle (E-Mail, Slack, Videoanrufe) aufrecht und stelle Fortschrittsupdates bereit. Ich folge agilen Methoden, teile die Arbeit in Sprints mit regelmäßigen Check-ins auf. Ich verwende Versionskontrolle (Git), Code-Reviews, Tests und Dokumentation während des gesamten Prozesses.

    "faq.07.answer":
      "Ich bin flexibel mit Kommunikationspräferenzen und passe mich an das an, was für Sie am besten funktioniert. Ich bin vertraut mit persönlichen Meetings, E-Mail, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoom oder Telefonanrufen. Für laufende Projekte stelle ich normalerweise wöchentliche Fortschrittsupdates bereit und bin für geplante Check-ins verfügbar.
